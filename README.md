🛠️ Making_a_drone
I'm a sophomore at ASU building my own drone from scratch. This repo will track the code, design files, and any chaos that unfolds along the way. Expect videos, experiments, probably some smoke, and eventual liftoff. I’ll be posting progress on Instagram too (because why the hell not).
🚀 Goals
✅ Build the drone frame (propellers, body, mounts, etc.)

🔄 Control DC motors using Arduino + keypad input

🔄 Switch to 3D printed components if it makes sense (still exploring options)

🔄 Develop from a Linux system (because I like pain, apparently)

🔜 Add actual flight control logic and fine-tune the whole beast

📹 Progress & Media
Planning to upload build videos, test runs, and crashes (hopefully not many) on Instagram. Will link here once things get spicy.

🧪 Notes
This is a work in progress. Things will break. Code will suck. Then it’ll suck less. Stick around if you’re into DIY drones, Arduino hacking, or just like watching dumb ideas try to fly — literally.
